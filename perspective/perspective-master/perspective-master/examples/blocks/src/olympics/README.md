Demo of [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) with 8,618 rows of Olympics
performance data from 4 different years (2 per season).

This dataset is bootstrapped off the [Ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/)
[demo page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ag-grid/ag-grid/master/packages/ag-grid-docs/src/olympicWinnersSmall.json),
and has no server component itself, showing how easy it is to use Perspective's
client-side architecture to get a fully-interactive BI experience, on top of
already-deployed web data artifacts without modification or intermediate servers.
